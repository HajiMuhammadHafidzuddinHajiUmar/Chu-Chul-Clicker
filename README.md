Clicker 'Chu-Chul' colour randomiser
------------------------------------
An idea inspired from a friend who was playing something similar as this after recently learning to code and this is my attempt in emulating it.

v1
- Attempt at making a colour changing button from an array of colours.
- Success but occasionally colours repeat.
- Success in preventing repetition.

v2
- Success create v2.0 Chu-chul using hex colour code to work
- Success create it using the codes in an array and use a loop to push the values
- Success in trouble shooting on changing colour on load 
    - Either script in body and call the function in js
    - or script in head and run the function onLoad

Rooms to imporve / explore
- Look into different ways
- Look into ways to add more randomness eg. no two codes are the same
- improve the general css; ie. give the texts some background, improve the look of the button and maybe implement some animation
- clean up code
